# Crowd Couting models using deep learning

## Topics

- State of the Art (Available models, available datasets)
- Implementation of some model
  - Test with images from testset
  - Test with images from TUM Campus

## Datasets
- ShanghaiTech
- UCF-QNRF
- UCF-CC-50
- Mall dataset: http://personal.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~ccloy/downloads_mall_dataset.html#:~:text=The%20mall%20dataset%20was%20collected,every%20pedestrian%20in%20all%20frames.

## Outlook
- Counting people in videos (tracking) - what are the challenges
